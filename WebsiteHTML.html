        <br>
        I am an Interior Design student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)
        <br> I'm from a small town in rural Maine. I enjoy skiing and going to the gym along with hanging out with my friends. 
        <br> I am excited to be studying Interior Design here at NJIT.
        <br> I've wanted to study Interior Design since I was in Elementary School. Ever since I watched HGTV with my mom, I knew I wanted to be an Interior Designer.
